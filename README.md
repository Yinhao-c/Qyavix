# SvelteCore

🌱 **SvelteCore** — A very small and simple front-end framework.  
Implemented in ~10 lines of JavaScript, it provides state management and automatic rendering similar to React or Svelte.  

Designed for developers who enjoy minimalism, want rapid prototyping, or are learning front-end framework principles.

You can call the website I have built: https://cdn.sveltecore.cyh.us.kg/SvelteCore.js. The URL may be invalid. I suggest you test it in advance.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is independent and NOT affiliated with the official Svelte framework.
The name "Svelte" is used to convey that this framework is slim, lightweight, and elegant.

## 🚀 Features

- 📦 **Ultra-lightweight**: Core logic under 10 lines  
- ⚡ **Instant rendering**: UI updates automatically on state change  
- 🧩 **Minimal API**:
  - `u(initialState)` → useState-like hook  
  - `r(Component, Root)` → render a component to the DOM  
- 🔥 **Zero dependencies**: Works directly in the browser  
- 🌍 **Extensible**: Can add routing, hooks, or multi-component support  
- 🎯 **Unique identity**: All rendered DOM elements include `dataset.framework='SvelteCore'`  
- 💡 **Educational**: Learn how front-end frameworks work under the hood  
- 🧪 **Experimental playground**: Ideal for experimenting with framework ideas

## 🎨 Quick Start

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script type="module">
  import { u, r } from './SvelteCore.js';

  function App() {
    const [count, setCount] = u(0);
    const btn = document.createElement('button');
    btn.textContent = 'Count: ' + count;
    btn.onclick = () => setCount(c => c + 1);
    return btn;
  }

  r(App, document.getElementById('root'));
</script>
```

## 🌟 Optional improvements
	•	You can rename the global object s to any character you like; s is just a minimal placeholder for SvelteCore in the code.
	•	All rendered DOM elements still include dataset.framework='SvelteCore' for identification.
	•	This setup supports multiple state keys and multiple components rendered into different DOM nodes.

---

## 📝 Roadmap / Future Plans
	•	Support for multiple states
	•	Component composition
	•	Simple routing system
	•	Event system and lifecycle hooks
	•	More example projects

 ## ❓ FAQ

Q: Can I use SvelteCore in production?
A: Yes, for small projects or prototypes. For large-scale apps, consider full frameworks.

Q: Does it support multiple components?
A: Yes, using different state keys and r() can render multiple components independently.

Q: Do I need build tools?
A: No. SvelteCore works directly in the browser as an ES module.
